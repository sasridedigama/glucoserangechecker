## Description
[glucose-range-checker](./glucose-range-checker/)
A way to "start the sensor replacement workflow" for replacing sensor due to extended inaccurate sensor.

  * On-demand, any time a fingerstick value can be compared against CGM to compare against 20/20 and 30/30
  * If inaccurate, worfklow consists of 3 hour set of tasks to:
  * wash, clean hands
  * perform fingerstick, compare with the checker
  * perform calibration and repeat once per hour
  * If all steps completed and still inaccurate, link into sensor replacement.
